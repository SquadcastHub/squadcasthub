**Note:**

To import multiple users to your Organization in one go, you can simply drag and drop a `.csv` file or, click on `select a file from your computer` on the top of the page to bulk import users. More information on this is available [here](https://support.squadcast.com/docs/import-users).

- The invited user will receive an email for verification. Until the user has been successfully verified, you will notice an icon indicating that `Verification Is Pending` against that User. 

- You can choose to resend the verification email by clicking on the `Verification Is Pending` icon should that be necessary. Please ensure that you check not only your _Inbox_, but also _Spam_ or _Promotions_ folders to ensure the verification email ended up landing there.

**Note:**

You cannot change or transfer the Account Ownership using this _Add Users_ flow. This needs to be done after the users have been imported.
