Follow the steps below to configure a service so as to extract its related alert data from Azure monitor. Squadcast will then process this information to create incidents for this service as per your preferences.

## Using Azure Monitor as an Alert Source

**(1)** Navigate to **Services** -> **Service Overview** -> select or search for your Service. Expand the accordion -> In the Alert Sources section, click **Add**.

<b>Important</b><br/><br/>
<p>When an alert source turns Active, it’ll show up under Configured Alert Sources, you can either generate a test alert from the integration or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.</p>
<p>An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service.</p>

## Create Squadcast Webhook in Azure

Login to your Azure account select your virtual machine. Under **Monitoring**, go to **Alerts**.

Then go to **Manage Actions** → **Add Action groups** → **Creatre action group** (Test grp or Squadcast webhook alerts) by selecting **Action type** as **Webhook**. Paste the squadcast webhook url from the previous step and make sure **Enable the common alert schema** toggle switch is turned on.

Go back to **Alerts** window and click **New Alert**. Specify Resource, Condition and under **Actions** select the action group (Test grp or Squadcast webhook alerts) you just made. Provide alert rule Name, Description and **Create Alert**.

Now whenever an alert is triggered by Azure Monitor, an incident will be created automatically in Squadcast. 

The Azure Monitor integration comes with an **Auto-Resolve** feature, meaning that whenever the alerts gets resolved in Azure, the incident will automatically get resolved in Squadcast as well.
