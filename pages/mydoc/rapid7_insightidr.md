## Create Squadcast Webhook in Rapid7 insightIDR

Refer to [Universal Webhook](https://insightidr.help.rapid7.com/docs/webhook#section-how-to-configure-this-data-exporter) for details of how to setup a webhook in Rapid7 insightIDR.

+ Paste the Rapid7 insightIDR Webhook URL copied from Squadcast dashboard in the URL field.

Now, whenever there is an alert in the Rapid7 insightIDR dashboard, an incident will be triggered in Squadcast. 

The incident needs to be resolved manually in Squadcast, once they are done in insightIDR dashboard since the platform doesn't send any webhook trigger for resolve.
