Notification rules are rules that determine how an individual user is notified of an incident assigned to them. 
You can set up rules to notify you on any of the following notification channels: 

- Phone Call
- SMS
- Email
- Push Notification from the Squadcast mobile app

{{site.data.alerts.note}}
<p><br/>Irrespective of your role in Squadcast, you will only be able to set your own notification rules. You will not be able to do it for any other member on Squadcast.</p>
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

You can access this by following the steps below: 

- Click on the **Profile** icon on the top right corner of the platform.

- Enter the amount of time after the incident trigger when you wish to get notified by a particular method and choose that method from the drop-down at the end of the rule. 

- You can also add new rules by clicking **Add More Rule** at the bottom.

- Click **Save** after making changes.

You're good to go. Now, when an incident is assigned to you, you will be notified based on your preferences set on the **Notification Rules** section.

Below the Notification Preferences, you can view the [Escalation Policies](escalation-policies.html), [Squads](squads.html), and [Schedules](schedules.html) that you are part of.
