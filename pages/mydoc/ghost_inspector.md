Follow the steps below to configure a Ghost Inspector service so an alert can be triggered whenever a UI test fails. Squadcast will then process this information to create incidents for this service as per your preferences.

## Using Ghost Inspector as an Alert Source

On the **Sidebar**, click on **Services**.

You can either choose to use existing service or [create a new service](adding-a-service.html)

Now, click on the corresponding **Alert Sources** button.

In the notifications window, under **Webhooks**, choose **Yes** for Enabled and add the webhook URL from above and make sure Frequency is selected as **Send once if the test fails, then once when it passes again**, so the alerts can be **Auto-Resolved** in Squadcast when the test passes again.

Go to your test suite settings and select the Notifications tab and make sure webhooks has **Use Organizational settings** enabled.

Alternatively, you can also choose to use different webhook URL's for different suites or tests and configure them to different services in Squadcast based on requirement.

The Ghost Inspector integration is good to go and if there are any failed UI tests, it will automatically trigger an incident in Squadcast and if the test passes again, the incident will get Auto-Resolved in Squadcast.
