Maintenance Mode enables you to reduce alert noise during the scheduled maintenance window. Alerts generated during maintenance windows would be automatically suppressed hence, no notifications are generated for these suppressed alerts. One can quickly list incidents that are in the suppressed state by simply filtering them in the [Incident List](incident-list-table-view#quick-filter-by-incident-status) page.
