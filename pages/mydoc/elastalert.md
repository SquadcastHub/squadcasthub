<b>Important</b><br/><br/>
<p>When an alert source turns Active, itâ€™ll show up under Configured Alert Sources, you can either generate a test alert from the integration or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.</p>
<p>An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service.</p>

## Setup Squadcast Alerter in ElastAlert

For details about how to configure ElastAlert to send alerts, refer [Running ElastAlert for the First Time](https://elastalert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/running_elastalert.html).

Configuration variables in rules YAML file

```yaml
alert: post
http_post_url: <ElastAlert Webhook URL copied from Squadcast dashboard>
http_post_static_payload:
	Title: <Incident Title>
http_post_all_values: true
```

{{site.data.alerts.yellow-note-i}}
<b>Note: </b>
<br/><br/><p>You can make sure that the 'Incident Title Name' and 'ElastAlert Rule Name' be the same in order to help identify the rule that caused the alert easily. <br/><br/>However, this is not mandatory.</p>
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

For more details on **post** alert type, refer [HTTP Post Alert Type - ElastAlert](https://elastalert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ruletypes.html#http-post).

Now, whenever an alert is triggered by ElastAlert according to the rules defined, it'll automatically create an incident in Squadcast. But, the resolving of incident needs to be done manually by going to Squadcast dashboard.
