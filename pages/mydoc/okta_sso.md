6.Your Okta SSO Integration is good to go and anyone in your organisation can now use Okta SSO to login into Squadcast.

7.By default, the SSO provider will send Firstname, Lastname and Email ID to Squadcast. If you can send a optional custom key called `role`  with one of these values `Admin`, `User` and `Stakeholder`, the user will be created with these roles instead of the default user role configured in the SSO modal in Squadcast.
