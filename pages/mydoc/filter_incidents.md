## Date & Time

The date & time filter allows you to filter down incidents to a specific time range. By default, the incidents within the last week are displayed. Change the filter by choosing a different option.

### Custom Range

The custom range options allow you to give a custom time range within which you would like to view your incidents. Here you can also select the exact time within which you would like to filter by.

## Tags

You can use the `Tags` filter to filter incidents by the tags associated with them. You can use the search box to narrow it down or check the relevant ones from the list shown. 

Choosing multiple Tag values will serve as a logical `AND` operation. Should you want to see the list of incidents for each tag, make sure to do so in multiple steps.  

When you are not filtering by any services, tags across all the services will be displayed. To narrow down your tags by service make sure to apply the service filter first.
