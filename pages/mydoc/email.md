<b>Important</b><br/><br/>
<p>When an alert source turns Active, itâ€™ll show up under Configured Alert Sources, you can either generate a test alert from the integration or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.</p>
<p>An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service.</p>
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## In the external platform which you are using: Configure the Email endpoint

Head over to the platform from where you want to route alerts into Squadcast. Navigate to the section where you can *configure the Email endpoint/integration*. Then, paste the copied Email address in the right placeholder and test this integration, if there is a provision to do so, and validate that the integration works. 

That's it, your Email integration is now good to go!

Now, whenever an Email is sent to the Email address of the Service, Squadcast will trigger an incident for it.

<b>Note</b>
<br/><br/><p>This integration does not support <b>auto-resolution</b> of incidents. If the platform you are using resolves an alert, you will have to manually resolve the corresponding incident in Squadcast via the <a href="https://www.app.squadcast.com">web app</a> or the <a href="using-the-mobile-app">Squadcast mobile app</a></p>

**Important**

- If you are sending regular emails - emails in the `text/html` format, URLs for images will appear as URLs only. If the image is added inline, only the name of the file will appear and not the image. However, please note that if the image is added as an attachment, it will not show up in the payload (and hence, the Incident Description).

- If you are sending emails as plain text - emails in the `text/plain` format, you can add images using the Markdown syntax `![image_name](image_url)`. The link of the image will appear in the Incident Description. Similarly, you will also be able to format the body content using Markdown, and the content with the same formatting will be displayed in the Incident Description.
