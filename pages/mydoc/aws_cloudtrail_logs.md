Please use this integration guide to configure CloudTrail log alerts so they can be received in Squadcast. This integration should be used only for getting CloudTrail log alerts via a SNS endpoint.

For CloudTrail alerts, use the [AWS CloudTrail via CloudWatch integration](aws-cloudtrail-via-cloudwatch).

For regular AWS CloudWatch alarms (like EC2 alerts), use the [AWS CloudWatch Integration](amazon-cloudwatch-aws).

## Using AWS CloudTrail Logs via SNS as an Alert Source

**(1)** Navigate to **Services** -> **Service Overview** -> select or search for your Service. Expand the accordion -> In the Alert Sources section, click **Add**.

<p>When an alert source turns Active, itâ€™ll show up under Configured Alert Sources, you can either generate a test alert from the integration or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.</p>
<p>An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service.</p>

Now inside the topic, click on "**Create subscription**" to get "Create subscription" dialog box. Select the protocol as "**HTTPS**" and in the endpoint enter the URL you obtained from previous step. Finally, click on "**Create subscription**" to create the subscription.

The "**Subscription ID**" for the subscription should to "**Confirmed**" immediately change from "**PendingConfirmation**". Click on the refresh button to verify the same.

Then you can [configure your CloudTrail log alerts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/configure-sns-notifications-for-cloudtrail.html) and assign this topic as the notification option and you are good to go.
