- In either case, fill in all the necessary details for the **Query Name** and **Trigger When** fields

- In the **Subject** section, add the below as is:

{% raw %}
```json
[{{ALERT_STATUS}}] {{ALERT_NAME}}
```
{% endraw %}

- In the **Body** section, add the below as is:

{% raw %}
```json
**Query Name**: {{QUERY_NAME}}
### Additional Information

[Query URL]({{QUERY_URL}})
```
{% endraw %}

That is it, you are good to go! Everytime an Alert is created in Redash, an incident would be created in Squadcast. When the Alert is resolved in Redash, the corresponding incident in Squadcast will be **automatically resolved**.
