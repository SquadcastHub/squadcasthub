This document will help you integrate Nixstats with Squadcast.

[Nixstats](https://nixstats.com/) helps keep track of your servers infrastructure usage, performance and downtime issues in addition to monitoring website uptime.

Route detailed monitoring alerts from Nixstats to the right users in Squadcast.

## How to integrate Nixstats with Squadcast

<b>Important</b><br/><br/>
<p>When an alert source turns Active, itâ€™ll show up under Configured Alert Sources, you can either generate a test alert from the integration or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.</p>
<p>An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service.</p>

#### Configuring Alerts for Server Monitoring

Now, every time there is an alert for your server in Nixstats, the alert will be sent to Squadcast and an incident will be triggered, notifying the right people. Similarly, if the alert gets resolved within Nixstats, it will get **auto-resolved** in Squadcast as well.

#### Configuring Monitors for Website Uptime

**(1)** From your home page, click on the *Monitors* tab on the top

Now, every time there is an alert for your website in Nixstats, the alert will be sent to Squadcast and an incident will be triggered, notifying the right people. Similarly, if the alert gets resolved within Nixstats, it will get **auto-resolved** in Squadcast as well.

That is it, your integration is complete and you are good to go!
