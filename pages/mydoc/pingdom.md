<p>When an alert source turns Active, it’ll show up under Configured Alert Sources, you can either generate a test alert from the integration or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.</p>
<p>An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service.</p>

**(5)** Now, associate this integration to any of yours checks on Pingdom

Here, we have simply associated this Webhook integration with one of Pingdom's Uptime Checks.

**Note**: Please check the **Alert when back up** checkbox. If this is not done, when an alert recovers in Pingdom, the corresponding incident for in Squadcast will not get **auto-resolved**.

**Test Alerts from Pingdom**

To check if the configured Webhook integration is functioning as expected, within your **Checks**, you have an option to do so. Against the configured Squadcast Webhook, click on **Test**. This generates a test alert to Squadcast. In Squadcast, you will be able to see the test incident created by this alert from Pingdom in the Incident Dashboard or the Incident List. This will confirm that the integration is working fine. You will have to **manually resolve** this incident in Squadcast.

That is it, you are good to go! Everytime an alert is created in Pingdom, an incident would be created in Squadcast. When the alert is resolved (changes state to **Up** or **Success**) in Pingdom, the corresponding incident in Squadcast will be **automatically resolved**.
