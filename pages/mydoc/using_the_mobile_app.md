### Unique sound for Squadcast push notifications

All the Squadcast push notifications have a unique sound on both iOS and Android applications to differentiate from other push notifications.

This should ensure that you get alerted on incidents and it doesn't get lost in the noise of other push notifications

### Incident Details Page

On the **Incident Details** page, you can take all the actions that are supported on our web app. The page has 4 major sections, namely:

- Details - The Incident details that come in from the incident payload
- Incident Activity Timeline - The Incident Activity Timeline specifies activities, such as Acknowledging or Resolving an Incident, Reassignment of an incident (mentioning both assigned and assignee), Actions that are run and so on.
- Events - The Incidents Events that are deduplicated against the parent incident
- Incident Notes & Starred Notes - All the notes created and starred for the incident

The **Incident Details** page allows for quick actions:

- Reassign - Reassign the incident to a different user
- Respond with Action - Take JIRA or CircleCI actions on an incident

### Notification Rules

You can configure how you want to receive incident notifications. We support Call, SMS, Email, and Push notifications. You can also choose the order in which any of these notifications should come through. 

You can add as many rules as you see fit.

<b>Note</b>
<br/><br/><p>If you <b>Acknowledge</b> / <b>Reassign</b> / <b>Resolve</b> an incident, the system understands that the pending notifications can be stopped. So, you will not receive any further notifications for the incident post this unless it has been reassigned to you again.</p>
