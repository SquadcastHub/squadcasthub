## Pre-requisites
1. A valid Squadcast cloud / On-Premise subscription 
2. A user account in JIRA Cloud with Administrator privileges

Follow the steps below to configure a service so as to push related alert data from Jira onto Squadcast.

Squadcast will then process this information to create incidents for this service as per your preferences.

## Using Jira as an Alert Source in Squadcast

**(1)** Navigate to **Services** -> **Service Overview** -> select or search for your Service. Expand the accordion -> In the Alert Sources section, click **Add**.

<b>Important</b><br/><br/>
<p>When an alert source turns Active, itâ€™ll show up under Configured Alert Sources, you can either generate a test alert from the integration or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.</p>
<p>An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service.</p>
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

{{site.data.alerts.yellow-note-i}}
<b>Note</b><br/><br/>
<p>Enable only the highlighted <b>Issue related events</b> as shown in the screenshot above. Squadcast will ignore any other Issue event type.</p>
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

Now whenever an issue goes to status-category with key **new** in Jira, an incident will be triggered in Squadcast . Also when that issue goes to status-category with key **done** in Jira, it will be resolved in Squadcast.
