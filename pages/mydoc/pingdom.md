Follow the steps below to configure a service so as to extract its related alert data from Pingdom. Squadcast will then process this information to create incidents for this service as per your preferences.

## Using Pingdom as an Alert Source

On the **Sidebar**, click on **Services**.

You can either choose to use existing service or [create a new service](adding-a-service-1)

Now, click on the corresponding **Alert Sources** button.

<b>Important</b><br/><br/>
<p>For an Alert Source to turn active (indicated by a <b>green dot - Receiving alerts</b> against the name of the Alert Source in the drop-down), you can either generate a test alert or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.</p>
<p>An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service in the last 30 days.</p>

Once a check gets **UP** or **SUCCESS** from Pingdom it will automatically be resolved inside Squadcast.
