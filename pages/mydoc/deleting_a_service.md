## Unable to delete Service and an error message is thrown

In cases where there are open (Triggered / Acknowledged) incidents for a service, the system will not allow you to delete the service without resolving these incidents. 

You will be able to see a similar error message in cases like these.

You will have to resolve all the open incidents and then follow the same process stated above to delete the service. 

To resolve multiple incidents at one shot, check out the [Take Bulk Actions](https://dash.readme.com/project/squadcast/v1.0/docs/take-bulk-actions) documentation.
