This document will help you integrate AppSignal with Squadcast.

[AppSignal](https://www.appsignal.com/) APM offers error tracking, performance monitoring, dashboards, host metrics, and alerts, built for Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Elixir, Node.js, and JavaScript.

Route detailed events from AppSignal to the right users in Squadcast.

## How to integrate AppSignal with Squadcast

### In Squadcast: Using AppSignal as an Alert Source

**(1)** Navigate to **Services** -> **Service Overview** -> select or search for your Service. Expand the accordion -> In the Alert Sources section, click **Add**.

<b>Important</b><br/><br/>
<p>When an alert source turns Active, itâ€™ll show up under Configured Alert Sources, you can either generate a test alert from the integration or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.</p>
<p>An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service.</p>

## Create a Squadcast Webhook in AppSignal Dashboard

Log in to your **AppSignal** web console.

**(1)** Select the app you would create incidents for. Now, in the left sidebar, select **Notifications**

**Important:**

When you click on the **Test Hook** button after adding the Webhook, AppSignal sends test data over a `GET HTTP Request` and **not** a `POST HTTP Request`. As a result, **you will not notice an incident in Squadcast** for the same. To test the Webhook, either generate or wait for real-time alerts to occur within AppSignal.

**(4)** Click on **Submit** to save this Webhook integration

That is it, you are good to go! Now, whenever an event in generated in AppSignal, an incident for the same will be created in Squadcast.

<b>FAQ:</b>
<br/><br/><p>Q: Does this integration support auto-resolution of incidents in Squadcast?<br/><br/>
A: No, this integration does not support auto-resolution of incidents in Squadcast since AppSignal does not send out alert resolve notifications via the Webhook.</p>
