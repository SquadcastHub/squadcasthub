This should generate a test alert from OSNexus QuantaStor, in turn triggering an incident in Squadcast. This will confirm that the integration is working as expected.

That's it, you are good to go! Whenever an alert is generated in OSNexus QuantaStor, an incident will be created in Squadcast. When the alert is closed in OSNexus QuantaStor, the corresponding incident will automatically get resolved in Squadcast as well.
