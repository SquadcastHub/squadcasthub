Follow the below steps to configure routing of your MongoDB Atlas / Cloud manager alerts to Squadcast. 

**Note**: MongoDB Atlas is the cloud hosted version of MongoDB offered by the company, whereas MongoDB Cloud Manager is the open source self-hosted version of MongoDB.

## Using MongoDB as an Alert Source

1. Navigate to **Services** -> **Service Overview** -> select or search for your Service. Expand the accordion -> In the Alert Sources section, click **Add**.

2. Select **MongoDB Atlas / Cloud manager.** Copy the displayed **Webhook URL** to [configure](mongodb\_atlas\_cloud\_manager.md#in-mongodb-atlas-cloud-manager) it within **MongoDB Atlas / Cloud manager**. Finish by clicking **Add Alert Source** -> **Done.**

<b>Important</b><br/><br/>
<p>When an alert source turns Active, itâ€™ll show up under Configured Alert Sources, you can either generate a test alert from the integration or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.</p>
<p>An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service.</p>
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

#### In MongoDB Atlas / Cloud manager:

1. Go to your MongoDB Atlas / Cloud manager Dashboard and click on **Settings** and click the **edit** icon on Webhook settings and enter the webhook url obtained from the previous step and click Save button. (You need Account owner permissions to do this in MongoDB)

2. Now we can add the created webhook as an alert mechanism for both new / existing alerts. Click **Add -> New Alert** to create a new alert.

The Alert is configured and integrated with Squadcast and whenever it is triggered in MongoDB, an incident will be triggered in Squadcast as well.

Squadcast automatically syncs the alert status from MongoDB as defined below. 

If a user Acknowledges the alert in MongoDB, Squadcast will also Acknowledges (**Auto-Acknowledge**) the incident in Squadcast, provided the same user (with same email ID) is also present in Squadcast.

Squadcast will **Auto-Resolve** the incident, if the alerts get resolved in MongoDB and doesn't require any manual intervention from the user.
