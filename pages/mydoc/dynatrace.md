**(4)** Next, to create a payload, that is to be sent to Squadcast via the Squadcast webhook,  insert the following JSON payload in the **Custom payload** section as shown below.

```json
{
  "State": "{State}",
  "ProblemID": "{ProblemID}",
  "PID": "{PID}",
  "ProblemTitle": "{ProblemTitle}",
  "ImpactedEntity": "{ImpactedEntity}",
  "ImpactedEntities": "{ImpactedEntities}",
  "ProblemDetailsText": "{ProblemDetailsText}",
  "ProblemSeverity": "{ProblemSeverity}",
  "ProblemURL": "{ProblemURL}"
}
```

More information about the JSON fields can be found in the list of **Available placeholders**

Now whenever an alert notification is triggered in Dynatrace, an incident will automatically be created in Squadcast. Also when an alert is resolved in Dynatrace, the corresponding incident gets **auto-resolved** in Squadcast.
