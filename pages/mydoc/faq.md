## 5. Do I still get billed when I deactivate my organization?

No, you do not get billed for when you have deactivated your account. However, if you deactivate your account on a mid-billing period, then you will get billed on a Pro-rata basis for just the active days. 

## 6. How many SMSs and Calls do I get for free in the Free Plan?

First 200 SMS Free; Post this, $0.1 per SMS
First 200 Calls Free; Post this, $0.2 per Call

{{site.data.alerts.yellow-note-i}}
<b>Note: </b>
<p><br/>This is calculated from the time of your subscription activation and not on a monthly basis.</p>
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## 7. Why is the card details needed on the file for the free plan?

At the end of the month, if you have crossed the SMS and Call limits, an invoice will be generated and the Account Owner of your Squadcast account will receive this invoice. 

If you don't have a card on the file and have missed an invoice payment, then your account will be deactivated and you will not be able to access the features on the platform without clearing the invoice value.

You will still be able to see the Billing tab from the navigation sidebar to add your card and clear the payment. 

You can simply add your card to the file at the start to avoid missing the invoice and deactivation of account as we understand that using the platform is crucial for your business.
