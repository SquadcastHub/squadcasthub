<b>Important</b><br/><br/>
<p>When an alert source turns Active, itâ€™ll show up under Configured Alert Sources, you can either generate a test alert from the integration or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.</p>
<p>An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service.</p>
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## Setting up a Squadcast Webhook in Loggly

Now log in to your Loggly account and click on "**Alerts**".

On the alerts page click on "**Alert Endpoints**" and then click on "**Create Endpoint**"

Select the type as "**HTTP Endpoint**", method as "**POST**" and enter the URL obtained earlier.

Enter the appropriate name and description for your endpoint and click on **Save**.
