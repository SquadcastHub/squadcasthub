Follow the steps below to configure a service so as to extract its related alert data from Runscope.
 
Squadcast will then process this information to create incidents for this service as per your preferences.

## Using Runscope as an Alert Source

1. Navigate to **Services** -> **Service Overview** -> select or search for your Service. Expand the accordion -> In the Alert Sources section, click **Add**.

2. Select **Runscope.** Copy the displayed **Webhook URL** to [configure](runscope.md#in-runscope) it within **Runscope**. Finish by clicking **Add Alert Source** -> **Done.**

{{site.data.alerts.yellow-note-i}}
<b>Important</b><br/><br/>
<p>When an alert source turns Active, itâ€™ll show up under Configured Alert Sources, you can either generate a test alert from the integration or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.</p>
<p>An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service.</p>
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

Now login to you Runscope dashboard and click on the Runscope icon at the top right corner and select **Connected Services** from the resulting options.

In the Advanced Webhooks window, Enter a Description such as **Squadcast Incidents** and select the Threshold as per your requirement.

For best results, select **Notify after a test fails in location atleast 1 times(s)** and  enable the checkbox labeled **and again after a test returns to passing**. This will help Squadcast **Auto-Resolve** an Incident once the parameters are back to normal.

Then paste the webhook url for the Runscope service and click **Save Changes**.

The Runscope integration is good to go and if there are any failed tests, it will automatically trigger an incident in Squadcast and if the test passes again, the incident will get **Auto-Resolved** in Squadcast.
