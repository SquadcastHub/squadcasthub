Please use this integration guide to configure CloudTrail alerts so they can be received in Squadcast. This integration should be used only for getting CloudTrail alerts via CloudWatch and a SNS endpoint. 

For CloudTrail log alerts, use the [AWS CloudTrail Logs integration](aws-cloudtrail-logs). 

For regular AWS CloudWatch alarms (like EC2 alerts), use the [AWS CloudWatch Integration](amazon-cloudwatch-aws).

## Using AWS CloudTrail via CloudWatch as an Alert Source

On the **Sidebar**, click on **Services**.

You can either choose to use existing service or [create a new service](adding-a-service-1)

Now, click on the corresponding **Alert Sources** button.

<b>Important</b><br/><br/>
<p>For an Alert Source to turn active (indicated by a <b>green dot - Receiving alerts</b> against the name of the Alert Source in the drop-down), you can either generate a test alert or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.</p>
<p>An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service in the last 30 days.</p>

## Create CloudTrail Alarm Endpoint in AWS SNS

Now log in to your AWS account and proceed to SNS.

Click on "**Create topic**" to get "Create new topic" dialog box. Fill in the details as per your requirements and then click on "**Create topic**"

Now inside the topic, click on "**Create subscription**" to get "Create subscription" dialog box. Select the protocol as "**HTTPS**" and in the endpoint enter the URL you obtained from previous step. Finally, click on "**Create subscription**" to create the subscription.

The "**Subscription ID**" for the subscription should immediately change to "**Confirmed**" from "**PendingConfirmation**". Click on the refresh button to verify the same.

Then you can [configure your CloudTrail alerts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudwatch-alarms-for-cloudtrail.html#cloudwatch-alarms-for-cloudtrail-security-group) and assign this topic as the notification option and you are good to go.
