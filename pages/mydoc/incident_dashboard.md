The **Incident Dashboard** is shown as soon as you log into the web application. This is the central console displaying all the incidents which have occurred in your organization and their current status.

You can filter your incidents by their status (Triggered, Acknowledged, Resolved or Suppressed) by using the tab based navigation at the list section.
