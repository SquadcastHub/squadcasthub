Add in all the relevant incident details in the pop-up. 

## Adding Tags to an Incident

By default, you will have the option to add **Tags** to an incident. You can do so by assigning the `tag name` and `tag value` in the text fields provided and you can also change the tag color by clicking on the blue circle. You can also add multiple tags by clicking on the **Add Tag** option provided on the screen.

## Creating an Incident without Tags

If however, you want to create an incident without adding any tags to it, you can click on the red collapse icon at the end of the tag row and create the incident as is.
