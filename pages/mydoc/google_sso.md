10.In the Attribute Mapping page, click the **ADD NEW MAPPING** button and add the following attributes and click **Finish** and **OK** in the next popup.

```
Required

first_name |  Basic Information  | First Name

email      |  Basic Information  | Primary Email

Optional - For overwriting the default configured role (choose 1)

role | Custom Attribute | Admin

```

By default Squadcast lets you create a user via SSO with a configured default Role ( Admin / User / Stakeholder) in the SSO screen as shown below but it can be overwritten by sending an optional custom field `role` and it's value along with the above attribute.
