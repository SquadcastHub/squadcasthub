This document will help you integrate GitHub with Squadcast.

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a provider of Internet hosting for software development and version control using Git. It offers the distributed version control and source code management functionality of Git, plus its own features.

Route detailed events from GitHub to the right users in Squadcast.

## How to integrate GitHub with Squadcast

### In Squadcast: Using GitHub as an Alert Source

<b>Important</b><br/><br/>
<p>When an alert source turns Active, itâ€™ll show up under Configured Alert Sources, you can either generate a test alert from the integration or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.</p>
<p>An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service.</p>

### In GitHub: Create a Squadcast Webhook

You can configure a webhook for a group or a project.

**(3)** In **Which events would you like to trigger this webhook** section, choose **Let me select individual events** and select the **below events** to trigger the Webhook. Next, click on **Add webhook**
 + `Issues`
 + `Pushes`
 + `Pull Requests`
 + `Releases`
 + `Repository Vulnerability Alerts`

**NOTE:** 

This integration supports the below GitHub events:
 + `Issues` (Supports auto-resolution)
 + `Pushes`
 + `Pull Requests` (Supports auto-resolution)
 + `Releases`
 + `Repository Vulnerability Alerts` (Supports auto-resolution)
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

That is it, you are good to go! Everytime an Issue, Push, Pull Request or a Release event occurs in GitHub, an incident would be created in Squadcast. When an Issue or a Pull Request is closed in GitHub, the corresponding incident in Squadcast will be **automatically resolved** for it. However, for Pushes and Releases, users will have to manually resolve the associated incidents in Squadcast.
