Follow the steps below to configure a service so as to push related alert data from StatusCake onto Squadcast.

Squadcast will then process this information to create incidents for this service as per your preferences.

## Using StatusCake as an Alert Source

On the **Sidebar**, click on **Services**.

You can either choose to use existing service or [create a new service](adding-a-service.html)

Now, click on the corresponding **Alert Sources** button.

{{site.data.alerts.blue-note}}
<b>Supported Monitoring Alerts</b>
<br/><br/><p>Alerts from Uptime Monitoring, Page Speed Monitoring, SSL Monitoring, Virus Monitoring and Server Monitoring are currently supported</p>
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

Now whenever an event is triggered in StatusCake, an incident will be created automatically in Squadcast. And for **Uptime Monitoring** once the event that triggered the incident(s) is resolved in StatusCake, the relevant Squadcast incidents created would get resolved automatically.
