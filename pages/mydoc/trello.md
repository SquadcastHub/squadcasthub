This document will help you integrate Trello with Squadcast.

[Trello](https://trello.com/) is a web-based, Kanban-style, list-making application and is developed by Trello Enterprise, a subsidiary of Atlassian.

Route detailed events from Trello to the right users in Squadcast.

## How to integrate Trello with Squadcast

### In Squadcast: Using Trello as an Alert Source

**(1)** From the navigation bar on the left, select **Services**. Pick the applicable **Team** from the Team-picker on the top. Next, click on **Alert Sources** for the applicable Service

**(2)** Search for **Trello** from the Alert Source drop-down and copy the Webhook URL

{{site.data.alerts.yellow-note-i}}
<b>Important</b><br/><br/>
<p>For an Alert Source to turn active (indicated by a <b>green dot - Receiving alerts</b> against the name of the Alert Source in the drop-down), you can either generate a test alert or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.</p>
<p>An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service in the last 30 days.</p>

### In Trello: Create a Squadcast Webhook

You can configure a webhook for a group or a project.

### Approach 1:

**(1)** Run below POST request from postman after editing `key`, `token`, `callbackURL` and `idList`

+ To see your `idList` Open a **card** in **trello** > Click on **Share** > Click on **Export JSON** > Find `idList` from JSON

![](images/trello_3.png)

+ Find your **token** and **key** [here](https://trello.com/app-key)

+ **callbackURl** - previously copied **Squadcast webhook URL**

NOTE: **Status** should be `200 OK`

### Approach 2:

**(1)** Run below Curl command after replacing `YOUR_KEY`, `YOUR_TOKEN`, `PREVIOUSLY_COPIED_WEBHOOK_URL` and `YOUR_idList` with `key`, `token`, `callbackURL` and `idList` respectively

```
curl --request POST 'https://api.trello.com/1/webhooks?key=YOUR_KEY&token=YOUR_TOKEN&callbackURL=PREVIOUSLY_COPIED_WEBHOOK_URL&idModel=YOUR_idList'
```

That is it, you are good to go! Everytime a card created in trello, an incident would be created in Squadcast.
