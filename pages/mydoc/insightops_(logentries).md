Follow the steps below to configure a service so as to extract its related alert data from insightOps.
 
Squadcast will then process this information to create incidents for this service as per your preferences.

## Using InsighOps as an Alert Source

**(1)** Navigate to **Services** -> **Service Overview** -> select or search for your Service. Expand the accordion -> In the Alert Sources section, click **Add**.

<b>Important</b><br/><br/>
<p>When an alert source turns Active, itâ€™ll show up under Configured Alert Sources, you can either generate a test alert from the integration or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.</p>
<p>An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service.</p>
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

Now log in to your insightOps account and go to alerts.

Click on "**Add Tag/Alert**".

Fill in all the details in the dialog box and for the "**Send to**" field select "**Web Hook**" and enter the URL obtained earlier.
