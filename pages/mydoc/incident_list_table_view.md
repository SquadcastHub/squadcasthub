The incident list view can be accessed by choosing the **Incident List** icon from the navigation sidebar. It gives you a clear view of all your incidents along with its relevant information at a single glance. From here you can perform bulk actions on incidents, get more information about an incident and filter incidents by service, alert source, assigned-to, and status.
