This document will help you integrate Heroku with Squadcast.

[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) is a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Route detailed alerts from Heroku to the right users in Squadcast.

## How to integrate Heroku with Squadcast

### In Squadcast: Using Heroku as an Alert Source

**(1)** From the navigation bar on the left, select **Services**. Pick the applicable **Team** from the Team-picker on the top. Next, click on **Alert Sources** for the applicable Service

{{site.data.alerts.yellow-note-i}}
<b>Important</b><br/><br/>
<p>For an Alert Source to turn active (indicated by a <b>green dot - Receiving alerts</b> against the name of the Alert Source in the drop-down), you can either generate a test alert or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.</p>
<p>An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service in the last 30 days.</p>
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

### In Heroku: Create a Squadcast webhook alert

**(1)** Go to the Dashboard page for your app and go to the dropdown menu below **More**. You will see an option to **View Webhooks** that will take you to the webhooks creation and management interface.
