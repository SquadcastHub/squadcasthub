Follow the steps below to configure a service so as to extract its related alert data from Sentry.
 
Squadcast will then process this information to create incidents for this service as per your preferences.

## Using Sentry as an Alert Source

On the **Sidebar**, click on **Services**.

You can either choose to use existing service or [create a new service](adding-a-service.html)

Now, click on the corresponding **Alert Sources** button.
