Follow the steps below to configure a Ghost Inspector service so an alert can be triggered whenever a UI test fails. Squadcast will then process this information to create incidents for this service as per your preferences.

## Using Ghost Inspector as an Alert Source

**(1)** Navigate to **Services** -> **Service Overview** -> select or search for your Service. Expand the accordion -> In the Alert Sources section, click **Add**.

<b>Important</b><br/><br/>
<p>When an alert source turns Active, itâ€™ll show up under Configured Alert Sources, you can either generate a test alert from the integration or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.</p>
<p>An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service.</p>

## Create a Squadcast Webhook in Ghost Inspector

In the notifications window, under **Webhooks**, choose **Yes** for Enabled and add the webhook URL from above and make sure Frequency is selected as **Send once if the test fails, then once when it passes again**, so the alerts can be **Auto-Resolved** in Squadcast when the test passes again.

Go to your test suite settings and select the Notifications tab and make sure webhooks has **Use Organizational settings** enabled.

Also, make sure that **Use Suite settings is enabled **for webhooks in individual test settings.

Alternatively, you can also choose to use different webhook URL's for different suites or tests and configure them to different services in Squadcast based on requirement.

The Ghost Inspector integration is good to go and if there are any failed UI tests, it will automatically trigger an incident in Squadcast and if the test passes again, the incident will get Auto-Resolved in Squadcast.
