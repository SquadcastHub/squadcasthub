Squadcast dashboard is the first screen that your Web App and Mobile App open into. 
This document will guide you through how these metrics are calculated and what they mean. 

## Incident State Metrics

Incident states metrics gives you a single view calculation of the number or volume of incidents in each of the respective states on Squadcast. 

### Triggered 
An incident is considered to be in the **triggered** state before any user responds to the incident notification. Once an incident is triggered it will notify the on-call user(s) based on their notification rules. This also means that the incident is in the **open** state. 

### Acknowledged 
An incident is considered to be in the **acknowledged** state when a user has acknowledged an incident and is working on resolving it. 

### Resolved 
An incident considered **resolved** when the user has fixed the issue and they want the incident to be closed. Once an incident is resolved, no additional notifications will be sent and the incident cannot be opened again. This is one of the two final states on the Squadcast platform.

### Suppressed 
All incidents that evaluates to be true to any of the supression rules configured for a service will automatically go into the  **suppressed** state. This, and **resolved** are the two final states on the Squadcast platform.

## Response Metrics

Response metrics indicate the time taken to Resolve and Acknowledge a triggered incident. Typically, response metrics are used as a baseline to improve your incident response processes. 

### MTTR 
Mean Time To Resolve is the average time taken to resolve incidents. When the dashboard is toggled to **Yours**, the incident summary shows your MTTR and when it is toggled to **All**, the MTTR for the whole organization is shown. 

Note: The MTTR is calculated as a separate metric for every organization that you are a part of on Squadcast.

### MTTA
Mean Time To Acknowledge is the average time taken to acknowledge incidents. When the dashboard is toggled to **Yours**, the incident summary shows your MTTA and when it is toggled to **All**, the MTTA for the whole organization is shown. 

Note: The MTTA is calculated as a separate metric for every organization that you are a part of on Squadcast.

## Percentage calculation for each metric

You will notice a percentage calculation under each of these metrics with an arrow that denotes if there is an increase or decrease in volume/performance. 

This percentage indicates a comparative calculation of the performance/volume of the metric in the  selected time period Vs the performance/volume of the metric for the same time duration in the past.

That is, if you have chosen the `Last Week` dashboard view, the percentages shown will be calculated this way: 

- Incident States Percentages = (Total number of incidents in each state this week / Total number of incidents from last week that are still in the respective states) * 100

<b>Example Percentage Calculation:</b>
<br/><br/><p>If you have 6 incidents in the Triggered state this week and you still have 2 incidents from last week which are still in the Triggered state when you are viewing the dashboard, then the percentage under Triggered should be: <br/>
Triggered% = 6 (This week) / 2 (Last Week) * 100 = 300%</p>
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

- Response Metrics Percentages = (MTTR/MTTA recorded for this week / MTTR/MTTA recorded for last week) * 100

{{site.data.alerts.blue-note}}
<b>Metrics Change with Dashboard View:</b>
<br/><br/><p>Based on the dashboard view that you have chosen, that is, Last week, Last Month, Last Year or a Custom Date Range, the metrics change as per the calculation stated above. <br/><br/>If a custom range view is chosen, the percentage are calculated the same way keeping in mind that the window of time period that is selected by the user (in days) is considered as the window of past metric comparison. <br/><br/>That is, if custom date range chosen is between 14th Feb - 17th Feb, then the time period selected here would be 4 days. So, this will be compared against the volume of incidents that have come in, in the past 4 days, that is, 10th Feb - 13th Feb. <br/><br/>The calculations would be as follows: <br/><br/>
<ul><li>Incident States Percentages = (Total number of incidents from 14th Feb - 17th Feb / Total number of incidents from 10th - 13th) * 100</li>
<li>Response Metrics Percentages = (MTTR/ MTTA recorded for 14th Feb - 17th Feb / MTTR/ MTTA recorded for 10th - 13th) * 100</li></ul></p>

<b>What does it mean when a response metric percentage is in red?:</b>
<br/><br/><p>Typically, the aim of an incident response system is to ensure that your MTTR and MTTA reduce. When an MTTR or MTTA percentage is in red, it means that there is an increase in the time taken to Resolve or Acknowledge incidents in comparison to the MTTR and MTTA performances in the past (same time duration considered as chosen in the dashboard view). <br/><br/>This is shown in order to improve the response times and is not meant to alarm the user or squads.</p>
