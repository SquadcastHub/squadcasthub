## What is StatusPage?

One of the core principles of SRE is Transparency and StatusPage helps you communicate the status of your services to your customers at all times as opposed to you getting to know the status of your service though support tickets logged by your customers. 

We launched a preliminary version of StatusPage to address this. Now you can configure your public facing services and their dependent components and show their status in real time directly all from within Squadcast.

### How it works?
You can configure the dependencies of your public facing services and then add them to StatusPage. You can configure the terminologies and the visual themes for Operational (Good) and Degraded (Bad).

Whenever the service has an incident, the status automatically goes to the status equivalent to Degraded (Bad) and when the incident gets resolved, the status of the service goes back to the Operational (Good) status or its equivalent status.

During an incident, you can choose to update the status of the incident directly from the Incident page by selecting the **Update StatusPage** option and update status like Acknowledged, Identified, Fix deployed, Resolved etc and accompany it with relevant description.

## Adding a StatusPage
To add a StatusPage, 

1.Click on **StatusPage** from the **Sidebar**
2.Click on the **Add Status Page** button.

3.Enter a **Name** for the status page and  enter the Domain / Sub-domain (eg: status.yourcompany.com or www.yourcompanystatus.com) where you want to host the status page under **Page URL** and copy the CNAME information and click on **Save & Next** button.

4.In the **Services Configuration** page, select the services which you want to show in the page and provide a suitable Alias for them.

If the selected service is dependent on other services, then you can configure the service dependencies by selecting **Dependencies** from the service page and add the related services.

## Setting CNAME record
When you try to view your StatusPage by clicking on the Status page or by visiting the configured URL, it won't be visible. 

![](images/statuspage_7.png)

You need to setup the CNAME of the Domain / Sub-domain to point it to `status.squadcast.io`. This can be done from your DNS provider such as GoDaddy, AWS Route 53, DO or CloudFlare etc., wherever your DNS settings are located.

<b>CAA Records setup: </b>
<br/><br/><p>All our StatusPages are served via https and we use a certificate generated by Letsencrypt, so if you had setup CAA record, please add letsencrypt.org  to the CAA record list, if not added already. This will prevent certificate issues for your StatusPage.</p>
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## Customizing your StatusPage

Once, the CNAME is configured successfully. You can view the status page by clicking on its name from the **StatusPage** tab.

### Update Header (Logo & Status Heading)

You can upload a Logo and change the default System status texts by clicking on the **Edit **→**Header**.

![](images/statuspage_9.png)

Then upload a logo for your status page and provide custom text for Good Status (eg: Opertaional, All good! etc) and for the Bad Status as well (eg: Degraded, Oops.., Something is wrong etc.)

![](images/statuspage_10.png)

This status will update the page status in the header.

### Configuring Service Status

You can also configure the Service status text and the colors by going to **Edit**→**Service Status**.

Then you can customize the text on the right and you can edit the color on the left by clicking on the color and selecting from one of the displayed options or enter your own choice by providing the HEX value for that color.

![](images/statuspage_12.png)

You can see the changes reflecting in your screen by refreshing the screen.

![](images/statuspage_13.png)

### Changing the colour theme
You can edit the color theme of your statuspage by clicking on **Edit**→**Theme**.

Then you can pick your colour from the visual colour picker or provide the colour values as either HEX, RGBA or HSLA and then click the **Save** button.

![](images/statuspage_14.png)

You can see the changes reflecting back as shown below.

## Making your StatusPage public

Now that  you are done with all the customizations, it's time to make the page public, so all your customers can view it.

To make a status page public, Go to **Edit** and check the **Make Public** check box as shown below.

![](images/statuspage_16.png)

Now anyone can publicly view the status page using the Public URL (say https://status.poniesareaweso.me)

![](images/statuspage_17.png)

{{site.data.alerts.yellow-note-i}}
<b>Public StatusPage getting redirected to our website?</b>
<br/><br/><p>If your Public StatusPage is being redirected to our website even after making it public, just clear your cache and try again. <br/><br/>
Should this also not work, do reach out to <a href="mailto:support@squadcast.com">us</a> and we'll help you out!</p>
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## Private Status Page

Note that if you don't check the **Make Public** box, your status page will be Private to your team members on Squadcast only.

{{site.data.alerts.note}}
<br/><br/><p>(See image below)<br/>
A Private Status page's URL can be shared with the team members who have access to Squadcast. But note that it is not the custom URL (red box) that is entered in the page configuration. It is the URL of the page in the app itself (green box). The custom URL is valid only for public viewers of the status page, that is if you choose to make the status page public.</p>
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## Updating your StatusPage

Whenever there is an incident for a service, that service will be marked as Degraded / Bad and you can start updating the StatusPage with different status such as Acknowledged, Fixed, Deployed, Resolved etc., and add relevant information as description.

In order to do this, go to the **Incident details page** and click on the three dots on the top right of the incident and click on **Update StatusPage**.

![](images/statuspage_19.png)

Then in the **Update StatusPage** modal, enter the **Custom Status** and **Custom Description**, select the StatusPage and click on the **Update** button.

{{site.data.alerts.blue-note}}
<b>Markdown supported: </b>
<br/><br/><p>Our StatusPage custom description supports markdown formatting.</p>
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

![](images/statuspage_22.png)

These updates will be reflected in the public StatusPage. 

![](images/statuspage_23.png)

## Enable Subscriptions to your StatusPage

To enable subscriptions to your StatusPage, go to **Edit**, click on **Subscriptions** and check the **Enable Subscriptions** checkbox. This will now show up as a clickable button on your public StatusPage.

![](images/statuspage_24.png)

You can then include the modes of subscription you want to enable for your StatusPage. 

+ **Email:** You can add a suitable text on the sender's email address text box from which all the subscribed users will receive StatusPage update notifications. In this case, all the subscribed users will get mails from 'updates@status.poniesareaweso.me'. 

+ **Webhook:** You can subscribe to alerts via webhooks as well. The payload format of the webhook is as follows:

![](images/statuspage_25.png)

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "unsubscribe_link": "<link_to_unsubscribe_from_webhook_alerts>"
  },
  "page_configuration": {
    "status_page_url": "<url_of_status_page_to_which_you've_subscribed>",
    "status": "<the_current_status>",
    "message": "<more_details_on_the_status>",
    "updated_at": "<time_at_which_status_updated>"
  },
  "updates": [{
    "status": "<status_of_corresponding_update>",
    "message": "<message_corresponding_update>",
    "updated_at": "<time_of_corresponding_update>"
  }]
}
```
