This document will help you integrate Twilio with Squadcast.

[Twilio](https://twilio.com/) allows software developers to programmatically make and receive phone calls, send and receive text messages, and perform other communication functions using its web service APIs.

Route detailed events from Twilio to the right users in Squadcast.

## How to integrate Twilio with Squadcast

### In Squadcast: Using Twilio as an Alert Source

**(1)** From the navigation bar on the left, select **Services**. Pick the applicable **Team** from the Team-picker on the top. Next, click on **Alert Sources** for the applicable Service

{{site.data.alerts.yellow-note-i}}
<b>Important</b><br/><br/>
<p>For an Alert Source to turn active (indicated by a <b>green dot - Receiving alerts</b> against the name of the Alert Source in the drop-down), you can either generate a test alert or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.</p>
<p>An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service in the last 30 days.</p>

That is it, you are good to go! Everytime an `Error` or `Warning` occurs in Twilio, an incident would be created in Squadcast.
