This document will help you integrate GitLab with Squadcast.

[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) is a web-based DevOps lifecycle tool that provides a Git repository manager providing wiki, issue-tracking and continuous integration and deployment pipeline features, using an open-source license, developed by GitLab Inc.

Route detailed events from GitLab to the right users in Squadcast.

## How to integrate GitLab with Squadcast

### In Squadcast: Using GitLab as an Alert Source

**(1)** From the navigation bar on the left, select **Services**. Pick the applicable **Team** from the Team-picker on the top. Next, click on **Alert Sources** for the applicable Service

**(2)** Search for **GitLab** from the Alert Source drop-down and copy the Webhook URL

<b>Important</b><br/><br/>
<p>For an Alert Source to turn active (indicated by a <b>green dot - Receiving alerts</b> against the name of the Alert Source in the drop-down), you can either generate a test alert or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.</p>
<p>An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service in the last 30 days.</p>
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

### In GitLab: Create a Squadcast Webhook

You can configure a webhook for a group or a project.

**(1)** In your project or group, on the left sidebar, select **Settings > Webhooks**

**(3)** In the **Trigger** section, select the **below events** to trigger the webhook and Click **Add webhook**
 + `Issues`
 + `Pushes`
 + `Merge Request`
 + `Releases`

{{site.data.alerts.yellow-note-i-md}}
**NOTE:** Squadcast supports only for below events  
 + `Issues`
 + `Pushes`
 + `Merge Request`
 + `Releases`
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

That is it, you are good to go! Everytime an Issue, Push, Merge Request and Release event occured in GitLab, an incident would be created in Squadcast. When the Issue and Merge Request is closed in GitLab, the corresponding incident in Squadcast will be **automatically resolved**.
