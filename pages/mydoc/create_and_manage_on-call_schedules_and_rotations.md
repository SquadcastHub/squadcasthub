Schedules allow you to create time-based rotations/repetitions for on-call schedules. You can see who is on-call on which day with monthly, weekly, daily and agenda views.

## Creating an On-call Shift / Schedule

1.You can create a schedule under **Schedules** â†’ **+** button at the right hand side of the screen.

![](images/schedules_2.png)

**Schedule Name**: Give the schedule a name which you can use while adding the on-call schedule to the calendar.

**Schedule Description**: This is a short description of the schedule explaining what it is and why it exists. 

**Schedule Color**: You can also set a color for a specific schedule, which will be used while rendering the on-call on the calendar.

2.You can click on any day of the calendar to create an on-call starting from that day. You can also drag from a day to another to automatically set the *Start date* and *End date*

- Every on-call shift must be a part of some pre-defined schedule. You need to choose which *schedule* you want to create this on-call shift for. 

- Input the *Start date*, *Start time*, *End date* and *End time* to determine when the shift begins and when it ends respectively. 

- Do not check the `Is Override` box if you want to create a normal shift.

- `Repeats`:

    Every Day - Use this to create a daily schedule

    Weekly -- Once a week: Use this to create a schedule that occurs on one day of the week 

    Weekly -- Particular Days Of a Week: Use this to create a schedule that occurs on particular days of the week 

    Custom: Use this to create any other custom schedule of your choice.

In this example we are creating a daily schedule.

Add in the users who would be on call for this shift under the `Assignee Groups` section.
Each group behaves as a different rotation. 

In this example we have two rotations: 

1st rotation - Tony Stark

2nd rotation - BoJack Horseman and Diane Nyugen

- Select the number of shifts after which you want to change the assignee group. 

In this example we have chosen the assignee group after every shift. Since we have picked a daily rotation each day for the specified time interval will be considered one shift. So, every day this schedule will alternate between `Tony Stark`  and `BoJack Horseman and Diane Nyugen`.

<b>Localized Timezones:</b>
<br/><br/><p>The selected timezone will default to the local machine timezone. This is especially beneficial for geography-based on-call rotations. <br/><br/>The teams will be able to view any created on-call schedule in their local time.</p>
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

{{site.data.alerts.blue-note}}
<b>Notifications to On-call Team</b>
<br/><br/><p>All members in an on-call shift will be notified via email 1 hour before the start of their shift.<br/><br/>
If the created override shift has less than an hour to begin, email notification will go out immediately after creation.</p>

### How to use Repetitions

#### Daily

Check the `Every Day` option to create a daily schedule.

## Creating a One-off Schedule / Irregular Schedule

One-off or non-recurring schedules are used to cover on-call for a short period of time but are not a part of the usual recurring rotations. 

In some one-off cases where one member of your team is asked to step in for another, cases where there's an unavoidable emergency or even in the case of planned vacations, you can create one-off  schedules. 

To setup a one-off schedule on Squadcast, you can just untick the `Repeats` box in the pop-up and complete the rest of the schedule configuration as per your need.

Click on `Create` to save this.
