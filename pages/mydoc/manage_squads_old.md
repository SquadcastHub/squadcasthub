## Defining a Squad

A Squad is a group of users corresponding to a team or a project. Squads are handy when you need to notify the entire group together. For instance, when coordinated responses are required for high-urgency, high-complexity incidents, or as the last level of an Escalation Policy when an incident is still un-Acknowledged at that point.
