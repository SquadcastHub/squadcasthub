## Pre-requisites
1.  A valid Squadcast cloud / On-Premise subscription

Squadcast will then process this information to create incidents for this service as per your preferences.

## Using Jira as an Alert Source in Squadcast

On the **Sidebar**, click on **Services**.

You can either choose to use existing service or [create a new service](adding-a-service.html)

Now, click on the corresponding **Alert Sources** button.
