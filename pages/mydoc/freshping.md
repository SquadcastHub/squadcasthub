This document will help you integrate Freshping with Squadcast.

[Freshping](https://www.freshworks.com/website-monitoring/) is a simple Uptime and Performance monitoring tool which keeps track of performance and downtime of websites, APIs, web services and web applications with real-time alerts.
Route detailed monitoring alerts from Freshping to the right users in Squadcast.

## How to integrate Freshping with Squadcast

<b>Important</b><br/><br/>
<p>For an Alert Source to turn active (indicated by a <b>green dot - Receiving alerts</b> against the name of the Alert Source in the drop-down), you can either generate a test alert or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.</p>
<p>An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service in the last 30 days.</p>

**NOTE**: When you click on the **Test** button, Freshping sends out **Resolve** alerts which do *not* create any new incidents in Squadcast. Please simulate real-time alerts to verify that the integration is working as expected.

That is it, you are good to go! 

Now, whenever Freshping generates an alert, an incident will be triggered for it in Squadcast. Additionally, once the alert that triggered the incident(s) is resolved in Freshping, the corresponding Squadcast incident would get **resolved automatically.**
