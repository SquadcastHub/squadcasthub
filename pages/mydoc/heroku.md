This document will help you integrate Heroku with Squadcast.

[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) is a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Route detailed alerts from Heroku to the right users in Squadcast.

## How to integrate Heroku with Squadcast

### In Squadcast: Using Heroku as an Alert Source

<b>Important</b><br/><br/>
<p>When an alert source turns Active, itâ€™ll show up under Configured Alert Sources, you can either generate a test alert from the integration or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.</p>
<p>An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service.</p>
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

### Supported Entities and Event Types

The below table indicates the Heroku Entities for which this integration would trigger and resolve incidents in Squadcast. If `Resolve` is mentioned against an Entity, it means the triggered incident in Squadcast will be automatically resolved when Heroku sends a resolve signal for it. For the other Entities, Squadcast users will be notified for the triggered incident. They will have to manually resolve these incidents in Squadcast once the issues are fixed in Heroku.

| Heroku Entities | Squadcast Incident Event Types |

| addon-attachment | Trigger |
| addon | Trigger |
| app | Trigger |
| build | Trigger, Resolve |
| collaborator | Trigger |
| domain | Trigger |
| dyno | Trigger, Resolve |
| formation | Trigger |
| release | Trigger |
