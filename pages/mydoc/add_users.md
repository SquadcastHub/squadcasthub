- Once you have entered all the user's details click on the `Send Invites` button, on the bottom left, to invite them to your organization. 

- The invited user will receive an email for verification. Until the user has been successfully verified, you will notice an icon indicating that `Verification Is Pending` against that User on the `User Page`. 
You can also choose to resend the verification email by clicking on the `Verification Is Pending`  icon should that be necessary.
