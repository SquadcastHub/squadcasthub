[Kapacitor](https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/kapacitor/) is a real-time streaming data processing engine in the TICK stack. It can process both stream and batch data from InfluxDB, acting on this data in real-time via its programming language TICKscript.
Route detailed alerts from Kapacitor to the right users in Squadcast.

## How to integrate Kapacitor with Squadcast

### In Squadcast: Using Kapacitor as an Alert Source

**(1)** Navigate to **Services** -> **Service Overview** -> select or search for your Service. Expand the accordion -> In the Alert Sources section, click **Add**.

<b>Important</b><br/><br/>
<p>When an alert source turns Active, itâ€™ll show up under Configured Alert Sources, you can either generate a test alert from the integration or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.</p>
<p>An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service.</p>

### In Kapacitor: Setup a Squadcast Webhook

**Method 1: Configuring Squadcast Webhook through Chronograf**

**(1)** From your Chronograf account, hover over the *Alerts* icon in the side bar, and select *Manage Tasks*

**(3)** Within the *Alert Rule Builder*, give the Alert Rule a *Name*, select *Alert Type*, *Time Series*, *Conditions*

Scroll further to *Alert Handlers*

**(3)** (b) Paste the Webhook copied from Squadcast under *HTTP endpoint for POST request*

**(4)** Click on *Save Rule*

**Method 2: Configure Squadcast Webhook in kapacitor.conf and use the endpoint in TICKscript** 

**(1)** Within kapacitor.conf, scroll to `[[httppost]]` and paste the following:

```
endpoint = "squadcast"
url = "<Copied_Webhook_URL_from_Squadcast"
headers = { Content-Type = "application/json" }
```

**(2)** Go to your TICKscript, within *alert* context, set up a [post call to the above configured endpoint](https://docs.influxdata.com/kapacitor/v1.5/event_handlers/post/#example-tickscript-using-a-pre-configured-endpoint)

{{site.data.alerts.blue-note}}
<b>Pro Tip:</b>
<br/><br/><p>In Mac OS, Kapacitor's configuration file is generally in <code class="highlighter-rouge" style="color: #c7254e; background-color: #f9f2f4 !important;">/usr/local/etc/kapacitor.conf</code> and in Linux machines, it generally is in <code class="highlighter-rouge" style="color: #c7254e; background-color: #f9f2f4 !important;">/etc/kapacitor.conf</code></p>
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

That is it, you are now good to go! 

Whenever an alert is generated in Kapacitor, an incident is triggered for it in Squadcast. When the alert recovers in Kapacitor, the corresponding incident will be **auto-resolved** in Squadcast as well.
