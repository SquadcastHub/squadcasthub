This document will help you integrate Amazon RDS with Squadcast. 

[Amazon RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/) makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It provides cost-efficient and resizable capacity while automating time-consuming administration tasks, such as hardware provisioning, database setup, patching, and backups.

Route detailed alerts from Amazon RDS to the right users in Squadcast.
