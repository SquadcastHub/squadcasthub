This document will help you integrate Datadog with Squadcast.

[Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) is a monitoring platform for cloud applications that brings in together data from servers, containers, databases, third-party services, thus providing observability into the entire stack. 

Route detailed monitoring alerts from Datadog to the right users in Squadcast.

## How to integrate Datadog with Squadcast

<b>Important</b><br/><br/>
<p>When an alert source turns Active, it’ll show up under Configured Alert Sources, you can either generate a test alert from the integration or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.</p>
<p>An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service.</p>

      (c) Copy-paste the following JSON in the text box under the **Payload** section

```json
{
    "alertId": "$ALERT_ID",
    "eventMessage": "$TEXT_ONLY_MSG",
    "title": "$EVENT_TITLE",
    "url": "$LINK",
    "alertTransition": "$ALERT_TRANSITION",
    "hostname": "$HOSTNAME",
    "orgName":"$ORG_NAME",
    "priority":"$PRIORITY",
    "snapshot": "$SNAPSHOT",
    "alertQuery": "$ALERT_QUERY",
    "alertScope": "$ALERT_SCOPE",
    "alertStatus": "$ALERT_STATUS",
    "eventType": "$EVENT_TYPE",
    "event_id": "$ID",
    "alert_metric": "$ALERT_METRIC",
    "alert_priority": "$ALERT_PRIORITY",
    "alert_title": "$ALERT_TITLE",
    "alert_type" : "$ALERT_TYPE",
    "event_msg" : "$EVENT_MSG",
    "incident_pub_id" : "$INCIDENT_PUBLIC_ID",
    "incident_title" : "$INCIDENT_TITLE",
    "incident_url" : "$INCIDENT_URL",
    "incident_msg" : "$INCIDENT_MSG",
    "security_rule_id" : "$SECURITY_RULE_ID",
    "security_rule_name" : "$SECURITY_RULE_NAME",
    "security_signal_severity" : "$SECURITY_SIGNAL_SEVERITY",
    "security_signal_title" : "$SECURITY_SIGNAL_TITLE",
    "security_signal_msg" : "$SECURITY_SIGNAL_MSG",

Click on “Save” to complete the service integration.

**NOTE:** You can find detailed information on the variables supported by Datadog that are available within the alert payload in Squadcast [here](https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/webhooks/).

**IMPORTANT:** Once the Webhook for Squadcast has been configured, ensure that the same is also selected as a channel within **Notify your team** in the **Monitor's** configuration.

That's it, you are good to go! Your Datadog integration is now complete.

Now, whenever Datadog fires an alert, an incident will be created in Squadcast for it. When the alert recovers in Datadog, the corresponding incident will **automatically get resolved** in Squadcast as well.
