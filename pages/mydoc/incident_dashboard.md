The Incident Dashboard is shown as soon as you log in. This is the central console displaying all the incidents which have occurred in your organization and their current status.

You can filter your open incidents or all the open incidents in the organization or only the incidents specific to you using the toggle button at the top. Also, you can use various filters to see incident by status, assignee name, integration type, size, etc.
