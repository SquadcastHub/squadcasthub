The following steps help in configuring a service so as to extract its related alert data from Logstash.
 
Squadcast will then process this information to create incidents for this service as per your preferences.

## Using Logstash as an Alert Source

1. Navigate to **Services** -> **Service Overview** -> select or search for your Service. Expand the accordion -> In the Alert Sources section, click **Add**.

2. Select **Logstash.** Copy the displayed **Webhook URL** to [configure](logstash.md#create-a-squadcast-webhook-in-logstash) it within **Logstash**. Finish by clicking **Add Alert Source** -> **Done.**

{{site.data.alerts.yellow-note-i}}
<b>Important</b><br/><br/>
<p>When an alert source turns Active, itâ€™ll show up under Configured Alert Sources, you can either generate a test alert from the integration or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.</p>
<p>An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service.</p>
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## Create a Squadcast Webhook in Logstash

In your Logstash configuration file (.conf), under output section add the following.

```json
       http {
           format=>"json"
           http_method=>"post"
           url=>"The URL obtained above"
        }
```

In case you want to filter the logs being sent you can use the standard Logstash output conditional statements. For example:

```json
   if [type]=="FOO"{
     http {
       format=>"json"
       http_method=>"post"
       url=>"The URL obtained above"
        }
    }
```
