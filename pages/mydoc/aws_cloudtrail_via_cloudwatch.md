Please use this integration guide to configure CloudTrail alerts so they can be received in Squadcast. This integration should be used only for getting CloudTrail alerts via CloudWatch and a SNS endpoint. 

For CloudTrail log alerts, use the [AWS CloudTrail Logs integration](aws-cloudtrail-logs). 

For regular AWS CloudWatch alarms (like EC2 alerts), use the [AWS CloudWatch Integration](amazon-cloudwatch-aws).

## Using AWS CloudTrail via CloudWatch as an Alert Source

**(1)** Navigate to **Services** -> **Service Overview** -> select or search for your Service. Expand the accordion -> In the Alert Sources section, click **Add**.

<p>When an alert source turns Active, itâ€™ll show up under Configured Alert Sources, you can either generate a test alert from the integration or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.</p>
<p>An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service.</p>

## Create CloudTrail Alarm Endpoint in AWS SNS

Now log in to your AWS account and proceed to SNS.

Then you can [configure your CloudTrail alerts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudwatch-alarms-for-cloudtrail.html#cloudwatch-alarms-for-cloudtrail-security-group) and assign this topic as the notification option and you are good to go.
