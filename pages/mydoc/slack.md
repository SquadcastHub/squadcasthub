We understand that most of your work happens over Slack. You can use Slack to do a whole bunch of things on Squadcast. Here's a quick brief of all that is possible. 

## Slack Notifications for Incidents

Squadcast can notify any new incidents to your selected Slack channel and you can take actions on your Squadcast incidents from Slack as well.

Firstly, go to the **Integrations page** from the sidebar and under **Slack** tab click on **Integrate** button and follow the on-screen flow.

That's it! Now you will start receiving alerts on your Slack channel and you can **Acknowledge** or **Resolve** Incidents directly from Slack.

<br/><br/><p>The email address used for both Squadcast and Slack must be the same for the integration to work</p>
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

Also, whenever an action is taken on Squadcast like **Acknowledge**, **Re-assign** or **Resolve**, it will get posted on Slack as well, so everyone can remain updated about the status of the incident.

## Bi-directional sync with your Incident War Room

<b>Bi-Directional Slack Sync Is Temporarily Disabled</b>
<br/><br/><p>This feature has been temporarily disabled due to the sudden deprecation of a dependant third party service. We are working on bringing this back soon.</p>

You can also bi-directionally sync warroom conversation with any Slack channel for the duration of the incident i.e., until the incident gets resolved.

To enable this, check out [**Incident War Room**](warroom.html)

## Create Incidents from Slack

You can create or send incidents into Squadcast from within Slack. 

To know more about how to create incidents from Slack, check out [Create incidents from Slack](slack-as-an-alert-source.html) in the Alert Source Integrations section in the Support Page.
